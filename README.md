# metodes_numerics_II

This project is all about numerical methods to perform basic mathematical computations such us integrations and obtaining irrational numbers such as pi, e and the golden number. Everything this project contains is the material I myself developed during the numerical methods course (part II) on Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona Physics degree. In this project you will find the following:

1. Irrational numbers. 
- You can find a pdf document where all the techniques and results are explained in detail and you can find a c++ code to obtain the number e. To my regret, I don't have the scripts to obtain the other numbers but the methods and part of the code can be found on the pdf. 
2. Integration Method
- A c++ code to perform a basic numerical integral and a pdf explaining the results and methods used.
